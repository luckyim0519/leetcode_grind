################# ACTIVITY SELECTION ###################

Acitivity selection problem is the combinatorial optimization problem corncering
the selection of non-conflicting activities to perform within the given time frame.

Q. What is combinatorial optimization ?
optimization that consists of finding an optimal object from a finite set of objects,
where the set of feasible solutions can be reduced to a discrete set. 

Methods of combinatorial optimization

There is a large amounr of literature on polynomial-time algorithm for certain special classes of discrete
optimalization. A considerable amount of it is unified by theory of linear programming.

For NP-Complete discrete optimization problems, current research literature incldues...
(1) polynomial-time exactly solvable special cases of the the problem at hand.
(2) algorithms that perform well on "random" instances (e.g. for the TSP)
(3) approximation algorithms that run in polynomial time and find a solution that is close to optimal.

##### Optimal solution ######
The acitivity selection problem is notable in that using a greedy algorithm to find a solution will

Greedy-Iterative-Acitivity-Selector(A,s,f):

// A is an array containing the activities
// s is an array containing the start time 
// f is an array containing the finish time 

    Sort A by finish times stored in f // in the increasing order of finish time 
                                       // O(n log n) time 
    S = {A[1]}                         // for the selected activities, and initializes it with A[1] that has the 
                                           earliest finisht time
    k = 1                              // to track of the index of the last selected activities 

    n = A.length                        
    for i = 2 to n:                    
        if s[i] >= f[k]:                
            S = S U {A[i]}              
            k = i                       // the index of last selected activitiy is updated.
    return S 

Proof of optimality
let S = {1,2 ... n } be the set of activities ordered by finish time.
