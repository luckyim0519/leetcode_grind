Okay.
I finally have to encounter the git branch...from ECE297 @ UofT!
I had so many problems with the git branch at this point.
So I would like to dive into git branch study a bit more.


>>> Defintion of the Version control system >>>

Version control systme is a software package that when
initiated will monitor your files for changes and allow
you to tag the changes at different levels so that you can
revisit those tagged stages whenver needed.

>>>                                         >>>

Okay for me, it was kind of making sense.
Because you might have written down something continously
and found that you want to re-use the old code and deleting
the previous one.
This is the reason why we need Version control system.

I have been doing this blindlessly in the past by just
copying and pasting the whole function code in the notepad
and reuse them... this is the very weak version control system!

>>> Why do you need a version control system? >>>

1. To manage the multiple versions of the same files under the 
sane name, thus avoiding the cluttering of files with 
small differences in their names

2. Markign the specific portion of the content in the files
that you might need in the future before changing them for present
needs.

3. To collaborate with the multiple prograammers.

>>> Types of the version control system >>>

There are two types of the version contorl system which are

1. centralized version control system
    many prograammers save their files in the common place where
    everybody has access to from their local machiens (clients).

                CENTRALIZED VCS SERVER
                 ㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡ
    User A --->  |   VERSION 1  |
                 |   VERSION 2  |
                 |     ...      |
    User B ----> |   VERSION N  |
                 ㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡ

2. distributed version control system

There is high risk involved in using a centralized version control
concept, on the cotnrary you lose the power to work collaboratively
when you use local version control.

you will combine the advavntage of both and maek a hybrid system.
